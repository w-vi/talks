# Linux Containers - the DIY way

## Elevator pitch
What is a Linux container and how you build them from the kernel
pieces at home.

## Description
Starting at Linux kernel features we go through the process of
creating a simple container. What features in the kernel are needed
and why, what syscalls and arguments and how to put them together are
the questions answered. We will slowly put together a simple
and naive implementation of a linux container. The goal
is to understand how it works and thus understand the limitations
and features available. Some of the aspects of real world containers
are not covered at all some just in a very simpilified manner as these
are topics in itself.

## Bio

He started with Pascal and x86 assembler and went up through the levels
of abstraction to Lisp within more than 15+ years. Interested in
bridging the gap between the low-level and high-level between the
server and client, between human and computer. There is no magic in
computers only clever tricks which he wants to be a master of.
