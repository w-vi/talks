# Linux Containers DIY


What is a Linux container and how you build them from the kernel
pieces at home.


Starting at Linux kernel features we go through the process of
creating a simple container. What features in the kernel are needed
and why, what syscalls and arguments and how to put them together are
the questions answered. We will slowly put together a simple
and naive implementation of a linux container. The goal
is to understand how it works and thus understand the limitations
and features available. Some of the aspects of real world containers
are not covered at all some just in a very simpilified manner as these
are topics in itself.

The talk was in Czech and so are the slides. All the info is available in
English on [http://wvi.cz/diyc](http://wvi.cz/diyc).
