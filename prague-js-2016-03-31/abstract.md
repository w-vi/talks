# Poor man's debugging and profiling node.js across the stacks

## Elevator pitch
Everybody knows that node.js is built using C/C++ and JavaScript but not
all of us know how to debug and profile across the two different
environments. Let's explore what options we have and how to use
them. From the basic v8 profiling to the advanced like inspecting
node.js process core dumps.

## Description
Everybody knows that node.js is built using C, C++ and JavaScript but not
all of us know how to debug and profile across those two completely
different environments. Let's take a deep breath and explore what
options we currently have and how we could use them to help us find
elusive bugs or bottlenecks. From the basic v8 profiling to the
advanced like inspecting core dumps or investigating `perf` stats all
can be done using open source tools. See how to use `llnode` the
`lldb` plugin for inspecting node.js core dumps and how to do low level
profiling when your JavaScript code is perfect but the performance is
far from it.
